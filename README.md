# Layer 2 Scaling Solution

A sophisticated Layer 2 scaling solution implementing state channels for off-chain transactions, deployed on Core Testnet 2. This project enables users to conduct high-frequency, low-cost transactions off-chain while maintaining the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain.

## Project Description

The Layer 2 Scaling Solution is a smart contract-based implementation of payment channels that allows two parties to transact off-chain with minimal on-chain footprint. Users can open channels, conduct unlimited off-chain transactions, and settle the final state on-chain, dramatically reducing gas costs and increasing transaction throughput.

The system implements a simplified state channel mechanism with dispute resolution, cryptographic signature verification, and automated settlement processes. This approach is particularly useful for micropayments, gaming applications, and high-frequency trading scenarios where traditional on-chain transactions would be cost-prohibitive.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize blockchain scalability by providing an accessible, secure, and efficient Layer 2 solution that bridges the gap between blockchain security and real-world usability. We aim to enable mass adoption of decentralized applications by solving the blockchain trilemma of scalability, security, and decentralization.

By implementing state channels, we envision a future where users can enjoy instant, near-zero-cost transactions while retaining the trustless nature of blockchain technology. This solution serves as a foundation for more complex Layer 2 implementations and contributes to the broader ecosystem of blockchain scaling solutions.

## Usage

### Opening a Channel
```javascript
// Open a channel with another participant
const tx = await contract.openChannel(participant2Address, { value: ethers.parseEther("1.0") });
```

### Updating Channel State
```javascript
// Update channel state with signed transactions
await contract.updateChannelState(channelId, balance1, balance2, nonce, signature1, signature2);
```

### Closing a Channel
```javascript
// Close and settle the channel
await contract.closeChannel(channelId);
```

## Contract Architecture

The `Layer2ScalingSolution` contract includes three core functions:

1. **`openChannel(address _participant2)`** - Creates a new payment channel between two parties
2. **`updateChannelState(...)`** - Updates the channel state with cryptographically signed transactions
3. **`closeChannel(bytes32 _channelId)`** - Settles and closes the channel, distributing funds according to the latest agreed state

## Network Configuration

- **Network**: Core Testnet 2
- **RPC URL**: https://rpc.test2.btcs.network
- **Chain ID**: 1115
- **Explorer**: https://scan.test2.btcs.network
